# Named-Entity-Relation-and-Recognition

## First Part:
* Find the nouns and verbs in both the novels. Get the categories that these words fall under in the WordNet. Note that there are 25 categories and 16 categories for Nouns and Verbs respectively.
* Get the frequency of each category for each noun and verb in their corresponding heirarchies and plot a histogram for the same for each novels. 

## Second Part:
* Recognise all Persons, Location, Organisation etc.: 
  1. First recognise all the entity and then 
  2. Recognise all entity types. 
  
## Third Part:
* Extract the relationship between the entities (mainly the characters involved in the novel). Try to do this as much as possible.
