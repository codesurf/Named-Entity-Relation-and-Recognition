# Named-Entity-Relation-and-Recognition
##First Part:

Find the nouns and verbs in both the novels. Get the categories that these words fall under in the WordNet. Note that there are 25 categories and 16 categories for Nouns and Verbs respectively.
Get the frequency of each category for each noun and verb in their corresponding heirarchies and plot a histogram for the same for each novels. 
##Second Part:

Recognise all Persons, Location, Organisation (Types given in Fig 22.1) in book. For this you have to do two steps: (1) First recognise all the entity and then (2) recognise all entity types. Use performance measures to measure the performance of the method used - For evaluation you take a considerable amount of random passages from the Novel, do a manual labelling and then compare your result with it. Present the accuracy here.
##Third Part:

Extract the relationship between the entities (mainly the characters involved in the novel). Try to do this as much as possible.
